    "[Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a popular number puzzle. The goal is to place the digits 1,...,9 on a nine-by-nine grid, with some of the digits already filled in. Your solution must satisfy the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The numbers 1 to 9 must appear in each 3x3 square\n",
    "* The numbers 1 to 9 must appear in each row\n",
    "* The numbers 1 to 9 must appear in each column\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't an optimization problem, its actually a *feasibility* problem: we wish to find a feasible solution that satsifies these rules. You can think of it as an optimization problem with an objective of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model this problem using 0-1 integer programming: a problem where all the decision variables are binary. We'll use JuMP to create the model, and then we can solve it with any integer programming solver."
