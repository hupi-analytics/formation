Noter l'apparition d'un nouveau paramètre: *maxBins* qu, schématiquement, rend qualitative ordinale à maxBins classes toute variable quantitative.  D'autre part, il n'y a pas de représentation graphique. Cette implémentation d'arbre est issue d'un [projet Google](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/fr//pubs/archive/36296.pdf) pour adapter cet algorithme aux contraintes *mapreduce* de données sous Hadoop. Elle vaut surtout pour permettre de construire une implémentation des forêts aléatoires.\n",
